      <h1>Joseph Quick</h1>
      <p>
        I am a student at the University of Michigan's School of Information,
        pursuing a degree in Information Sciences with a focus on User
        Experience Design. Outside of school, I have deep passions for both
        travel and photography. I left the United States for the first time in
        2018 and it changed my entire perspective, I've had the "travel bug"
        ever since. While on the go, I've spent a lot of time taking pictures
        with film cameras and recording short reels of video via drones.
